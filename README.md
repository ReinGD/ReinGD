- 👋 Hi, I’m @ReinGD, let's keep this basic 
- 👀 I’m interested in Tools, Graphics and Engine Programming 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Vulkan and Unreal Engine
- 💞️ I specialize primarily in Engine, Graphics and Tools Programming for game development. Check out my portfolio here! https://reingd.github.io/portfolio/
- 📫 How to reach me? Check out my LinkedIn and send me a connect request. https://www.linkedin.com/in/reingd

There are some elements of my projects that I have kept private on purpose, for example these projects:

* File
* Manager
* GDUtils
* Math
* PCSTree

I will provide source code for these projects for interview purposes when requested.

I am adding my projects slowly as I redo them, I have learned many things over the years and I am applying them to my projects, but if you need to see my code for any project not listed here do let me know.
