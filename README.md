- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Vulkan and Unreal Engine

  * Check out my LinkedIn and send me a connect request. https://www.linkedin.com/in/reingd
  * Or follow me on Mastodon <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@ReinGD">@ReinGD</a>

FYI:

There are some elements of my projects that I have kept private on purpose, for example these projects:

* File
* Manager
* GDUtils
* Math
* PCSTree

I will provide source code for these projects for interview purposes when requested.

I am adding my projects slowly as I redo them, I have learned many things over the years and I am applying them to my projects, but if you need to see my code for any project not listed here do let me know.
